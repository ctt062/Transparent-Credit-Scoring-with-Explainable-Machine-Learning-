# 🏦 Transparent Credit Scoring with Explainable Machine Learning

A machine learning project focused on building an **interpretable** and **accurate** credit scoring system, developed for the **Engineering Foundations in FinTech (IEDA4500)** course at **HKUST**.

## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Classify individuals into Good, Standard, or Poor credit categories
- Maintain high accuracy while improving transparency using SHAP explainability

## ⚙️ Techniques & Tools
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Debt-to-Income (DTI)
  - EMI-to-Salary ratio
- **Models Compared:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest (selected)
  - XGBoost

## 🔍 Explainability
- Used SHAP values to interpret both global and local model behavior
- Identified top drivers of credit risk: Monthly Balance, Payment Behaviour, Age

## 📊 Results
- **Accuracy:** ~80%
- **Macro F1-Score:** 0.79
- Generated CSV with credit score probabilities for downstream integration

## 📂 Files
- `notebooks/`: Model training and SHAP explanation scripts
- `report.pdf`: Final documentation
- `slides.pdf`: Presentation deck
